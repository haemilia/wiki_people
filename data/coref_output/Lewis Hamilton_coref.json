As with the season before, two four-time World Champions, Hamilton and Vettel appeared to have the upper hand for much of The 2018 season, topping the standings until the half-way point. However, Ferrari's Sebastian Vettel's unravelled with a number of driver and mechanical errors, while [0]'s run of six wins in seven in the latter half of The 2018 season saw [0] clinch the title in Mexico for a second year running as [0] set a new record for the most points scored in a season (408). During Vettel's season, [0] signed a two-year contract with Mercedes, reported to be worth up to \u00a340\u00a0million per year, making [0] the best-paid Formula One driver in history.Having signed a two-year contract with Mercedes, reported to be worth up to \u00a340\u00a0million per year, it was confirmed [0] would defend [0]'s title in 2019.

Four days after the last race in Abu Dhabi, the FIA announced that the FIA would conduct an internal investigation into the incident. race director Michael Masi's was subsequently removed from race director Michael Masi's's role as race director, with the FIA World Motor Sport Council report finding that \"human error\" resulted in the failure to follow Formula One Sporting Regulations concerning the withdrawal of the safety car, but also that the final standings \"are valid, final and cannot now be changed.\" Notwithstanding the controversy in Abu Dhabi, BBC Sport's Andrew Benson described the 2021 season as \"one of the most intense, hard-fought battles in sporting history\", with him and Rosberg Red Bull's Max Verstappen having \"been head and shoulders\u2014and a lot more\u2014clear of every other driver on the grid.[0] was partnered by George Russell for 2022, in place of Bottas'. 2022 saw significant changes in technical regulations which sought to utilise ground effect to generate downforce.

The Mercedes W13 suffered with extreme porpoising early in 2022 which limited The Mercedes W13's potential; at the Saudi Arabian Grand Prix, [0] deemed The Mercedes W13 \"undrivable\". During the first half of 2022, [0] was marginally low on points compared to George Russell, despite having been involved in the development of The Mercedes W13, [0] had to try on experimental car setups until the 2019 United States Grand Prix.

Jim Holden writing in Autocar has suggested that racial bias may have contributed towards [0]'s perceived lack of popularity relative to [0]'s achievements, with [0]'s race and physical appearance \u2013 being mixed-race and often seen sporting earrings, dreadlocks and designer clothing \u2013 alienating some of Formula One's traditional white, elderly male fanbase. Others have attributed [0]'s lack of appreciation to the perceived predictability of results during the turbo-hybrid era, likening [0]'s period of dominance to that of Schumacher in the early 2000s, and to tennis players Steffi Graf and Martina Navratilova, all of whom became more appreciated in the latter part of tennis players Steffi Graf and Martina Navratilova's careers.What strikes me now about [0] now is [0]'s maturity ... [[0]] recognises [0] is a role model and the influence he has and the responsibilities that come with the influence he has. [0] is far broader than purely a driver in Formula One. [0] has opinions about the environment, young people, fashion and music. opinions about the environment, young people, fashion and music is part of the greater appeal of [0] today.\u2014David Richards, chairman of Motorsport UK, speaking of [0] in [0]'s jet-set lifestyle and interests outside Formula One have been scrutinised. [0] has been praised for disregarding convention and public opinion and has been described as one of the last superstar drivers. Between race weekends [0] has on several occasions travelled around the world to explore a variety of interests, such as in 2018 where, after winning the Italian Grand Prix, [0] flew to Shanghai and New York where [0] released [0]'s own designer clothing line with Tommy Hilfiger, before flying immediately back to, and winning, the next race in Singapore. Toto Wolff has been vocal in Toto Wolff's support for [0]'s off-track pursuits, explaining how freedom allows [0] to function at [0]'s best.Figures in the sport such as Emerson Fittipaldi and Christian Horner have voiced Figures in the sport such as Emerson Fittipaldi and Christian Horner's support for [0]'s ability to connect with fans, while Bernie Ecclestone frequently commented on Bernie Ecclestone's admiration of [0]'s ability to promote Formula One, noting how [0] is happy to engage with fans, unlike some of [0]'s peers. Since Hamilton's rookie season in 2007, Formula One's annual global revenue rose by 53%, to $1.83\u00a0billion as of 31 July 2016. Sports journalist for The Telegraph, Luke Slater, goes as far as to argue that \"here have been few better representatives of Formula One than [0] ... [both] on and off the track.\" Following [0]'s knighthood in 2020, newly appointed Formula One CEO Stefano Domenicali said that [0] \"is a true giant of Formula One\" and that \"[0]'s influence is huge both in and out of a car.[0] was able to win with a dominant car, with a good car like 2010 or 2012, or with bad cars like 2009 and 2011. Not all the champions can say that.\u2014Fernando Alonso, speaking of [0] in 2017A prodigious talent as a teenager, [0] established [0] as one of the world's best drivers following Hamilton's rookie season in 2007. Paddy Lowe has suggested that \"[0] turned out to be the best rookie there has ever been\" and that \"[0]'s first half-season is just the most extraordinary in history.\" After [0]'s first world title a year later, many people considered [0] the best driver of [0]'s generation. Following Red Bull and Sebastian Vettel's four-year dominance of Formula One, [0]'s resolve was tested both professionally and personally as [0] did not finish higher than fourth in the Drivers' Championship from 2009 to 2013, leading some to question [0]'s status as the best driver in Formula One. In spite of this, [0]'s less successful years with McLaren have also been cited as a demonstration of driving ability as [0] has won at least one race in fifteen consecutive seasons, attracting high praise from experts and fellow drivers for extracting race-winning performances from cars that were not dominant.After [0] clinched [0]'s second and third World Championship titles with Mercedes in 2014 and 2015, David Coulthard declared [0] the best driver of his generation, calling [0] \"the Ayrton Senna of his generation\", an opinion which was widely accepted among the public, experts, and fellow and former drivers. As [0] became more widely considered the best driver of his generation, public and expert debate moved from [0]'s status in Formula One to [0]'s status among the greatest drivers in history. The next few seasons saw [0] eclipse a number of records, including achieving the most all-time pole positions ahead of Schumacher, leading [0] to be regarded by some as the greatest qualifier in history. After winning [0]'s fourth and fifth world titles, [0]'s place among the greats of Formula One became firmly established in the opinions of experts, rivals and teammates alike, with some journalists and pundits considering the possibility of [0] being the greatest Formula One driver of all time.Following [0] clinching a sixth World Drivers' Championship title in 2019, ex-Formula One driver and pundit Johnny Herbert acclaimed [0] as the greatest driver ever, a sentiment echoed by [0]'s Mercedes team-boss Toto Wolff, who described [0] as \"maybe the best driver that has ever existed\", while Formula One staff writer, Greg Stuart, described [0] as \"arguably the most complete Formula [One] driver ever\". After [0] won [0]'s seventh title in 2020, John Watson stated that [0] \"is, by a million miles, the greatest driver of his generation and you can argue [0] will go on to be the greatest Formula One driver of all time\", and highlighted [0]'s fearlessness as being key to [0]'s success, as evidenced by [0]'s performance against double world champion team-mate Alonso in [0]'s rookie season and [0]'s decision to leave McLaren for Mercedes. ex-Formula One driver and pundit Johnny Herbert compared [0] to tennis player Roger Federer and golfer Tiger Woods.", "Helmet": "Lewis Hamilton is our person to focus on. From a young age, [0]'s helmet throughout [0]'s karting years was predominantly yellow with blue, green and red ribbons. In later years a white ring was added and blue, green and red ribbons were moved forward to make room for logos and advertisement space. [0] continued to run a predominantly yellow design for the early stage of his Formula One career, but in 2014 decided to change to a mostly white approach. In 2017, [0] selected his helmet design from fan submissions. his helmet design used a white and yellow base colour with red and orange details, and the addition of three stars, one for each of [0]'s three Formula One championships at that time, on either side. Over the following seasons, [0] continued to add more stars to his helmet design on winning further World Championship titles.[0] has worn specially designed one-off helmets for several weekends throughout his Formula One career. At the 2010 Monaco Grand Prix, [0] sported an altered helmet design with the addition of a roulette wheel image on the top. At the 2015 Malaysian Grand Prix, [0] brought with [0] a striking blue-and-green design in honour of team sponsor Petronas but was prevented from using a striking blue-and-green design by the FIA. [0] has sported gold coloured helmets three times in his Formula One career. After winning [0]'s fourth title in 2017, [0] entered 2017 Abu Dhabi Grand Prix in a gold helmet with four stars adorning the top of the helmet with the words World Champion. [0] wore a gold helmet at the 2018 Abu Dhabi Grand Prix after sealing [0]'s fifth world title, towards which [0] made reference with five stars on either side of the design, and did so again at the 2019 Abu Dhabi Grand Prix, this time with six stars following [0]'s sixth World Championship title.[0] has also used one-off helmet designs to pay tribute to influential figures in his Formula One career. At the 2011 Brazilian Grand Prix, [0] wore a special helmet in tribute to Ayrton Senna which was auctioned after the race in aid of the Ayrton Senna Foundation. At the 2019 Abu Dhabi Grand Prix, [0], like fellow driver Sebastian Vettel, wore a special helmet to pay tribute to Niki Lauda, who died at the start of the week. a special helmet was painted red and white, Niki Lauda, who died at the start of the week's classic colours, and had [0]'s name printed on the back. After the 2019 Abu Dhabi Grand Prix, [0] reflected on Niki Lauda, who died at the start of the week's career, saying: \"Ultimately, as a driver, [0]'s goal one day is to hopefully be as respected as Niki Lauda, who died at the start of the week was ... Niki Lauda, who died at the start of the week's definitely someone who led by a great example, left a great example, and was a real hero to so many.\" [0] again wore a special helmet to pay tribute to Ayrton Senna at the 2019 Abu Dhabi Grand Prix.[0] switched into a different design in 2020, which used black as base colour with purple details, in support of Black Lives Matter, [0] also continued to use a different design in 2021. [0] wore a rainbow helmet at the 2021 Qatar Grand Prix, 2021 Saudi Arabian Grand Prix, and 2021 Abu Dhabi Grand Prix in support of the LGBTQ+ community. Ahead of the 2022 season, [0] reverted to using a yellow helmet design for the first time since 2013, a yellow helmet design also used purple details. [0] also used one-off designs for the 2022 Monaco Grand Prix, 2022 Japanese Grand Prix and 2022 Sao Paulo Grand Prix. [0] retained a yellow helmet design in 2023.", "Rivalries": "[0] is our person to focus on. [0]'s debut season saw [0] partner two-time and defending World Champion Fernando Alonso. In their time as teammates, tensions arose between their and McLaren as a result of several incidents. The first tensions surfaced after [0] finished second behind two-time and defending World Champion Fernando Alonso at Monaco in 2007. After post-race comments made by [0] which suggested [0] had been forced into a supporting role, McLaren investigated whether McLaren had broken rules by enforcing team orders. McLaren denied favouring two-time and defending World Champion Fernando Alonso, and McLaren subsequently vindicated McLaren, stating that \"McLaren were able to pursue an optimum team strategy because McLaren had a substantial advantage over all other cars ... nothing which could be described as interfering with the race result.\"Tensions surfaced again at the 2007 Hungarian Grand Prix, where during the final qualifying session [0] went out on track ahead of two-time and defending World Champion Fernando Alonso and ignored requests from McLaren to let [0] through: their had been taking turns on a race-by-race basis to lead during qualifying, which gave the leading driver an edge due to the fuel load regulations then in place, and two-time and defending World Champion Fernando Alonso was due to lead in Hungary. [0] was then delayed in the pits by two-time and defending World Champion Fernando Alonso and thus unable to set a final lap time before the end of the final qualifying session. two-time and defending World Champion Fernando Alonso was relegated to sixth place on the starting grid thus promoting [0] to first, while McLaren was docked Constructors' Championship points. [0] said [0] thought docked was \"quite light if anything\" and only regretted docked. [0] was reported to have sworn at Dennis on the team radio following the final qualifying session. British motorsport journal Autosport claimed that sworn \"[led] Dennis to throw Dennis's headphones on the pit wall in disgust: a gesture that was misinterpreted by many to be in reaction to two-time and defending World Champion Fernando Alonso's pole\"; however, McLaren later issued a statement on behalf of [0] that denied sworn.As a result of the events over the 2007 season, the relationship between [0] two-time and defending World Champion Fernando Alonso reportedly collapsed, with their not on speaking terms for a short period. In the aftermath it was reported that [0] had been targeted by Luca di Montezemolo regarding a Ferrari drive for 2008. The rivalry between their led to speculation that either [0] or two-time and defending World Champion Fernando Alonso would leave McLaren at the end of the 2007 season; two-time and defending World Champion Fernando Alonso McLaren terminated their's contract by mutual consent in November the 2007 season, ending two-time and defending World Champion Fernando Alonso's time as teammates. In subsequent years, tensions between their dissipated, and the mutual respect has grown, with two-time and defending World Champion Fernando Alonso praising [0] in 2017 saying \"[0] [0]was able to win with a dominant car, with a good car like 2010 or 2012, or with bad cars like 2009 and 2011. Not all the champions can say that.\" two-time and defending World Champion Fernando Alonso later described [0] as one of the top five greatest drivers of all time. On the cool-down lap after two-time and defending World Champion Fernando Alonso's final race before two-time and defending World Champion Fernando Alonso's two-year hiatus in 2018, [0] joined Sebastian Vettel in paying tribute to two-time and defending World Champion Fernando Alonso by driving, each on one side, in a formation to the start-finish straight where all three executed donuts.In their time as teammates, [0] two-time and defending World Champion Fernando Alonso won 8 of 17 races in the 2007 Formula One season. [0] had 4 victories, 12 podium finishes and qualified ahead of two-time and defending World Champion Fernando Alonso 10 times. two-time and defending World Champion Fernando Alonso also had 4 victories, 12 podium finishes but qualified ahead of [0] only 7 times. At the end of their time as teammates, their were tied on 109 points, with [0] placing second and two-time and defending World Champion Fernando Alonso third in the World Drivers' Championship by virtue of [0] having more second-place finishes.When [0] joined Mercedes in 2013, [0] was paired alongside old karting teammate and friend Nico Rosberg. Over their's four seasons as teammates, a period of Mercedes dominance in Formula One, their's relationship became strained and, at times, led to volatile confrontations on and off the track. [0] old karting teammate and friend Nico Rosberg were first teammates in 2000, when their were in karting. their raced for McLaren in Formula A, where [0] became European champion, with old karting teammate and friend Nico Rosberg not far behind. Robert Kubica, who raced with their before Formula One, recalled how their were competitive both on and off the track, saying that \"their would even have races to eat pizza, always eating two at a time.\" Sports journalist Paul Weaver contrasts their's upbringings; old karting teammate and friend Nico Rosberg, was born in Germany but brought up in Monaco and was the son of a wealthy former Formula One world champion, Keke Rosberg, whereas [0] was born on a council estate in Stevenage, and a wealthy former Formula One world champion, Keke Rosberg had to work multiple jobs to fund a wealthy former Formula One world champion, Keke Rosberg's junior racing.Pundit and commentator Will Buxton compared the character and driving styles of their, labelling [0] as the faster driver with more natural ability but with an intellect to match old karting teammate and friend Nico Rosberg's. Pundit and commentator Will Buxton wrote:Man to man against old karting teammate and friend Nico Rosberg, Pundit and commentator Will Buxton can't recall a single race this year where in the same machinery [0]'s fuel usage has been higher. [0] has made his tires last. [0] has had to fight from the back of the field time and again (think Germany, think Hungary) and yet [0] hasn't overworked his tires, [0] hasn't used too much fuel. [0] has learned how to drive these new cars, and to extract the most from these new cars using the least ... Far from the unintelligent chancer many paint [0] to be, [0] is proving to be the intellectual match of old karting teammate and friend Nico Rosberg and, the better racer to boot. Their old karting boss, Dino Chiesa, said [0] was the faster driver whereas old karting teammate and friend Nico RosbergTheir old karting boss, Dino Chiesa , was always more analytical. This led some to believe that old karting teammate and friend Nico Rosberg would achieve greater success in Formula One, due to the intellectual capacity required to manage brakes, energy harvesting, tyre management and moderate fuel usage. However, [0]'s tyre management has frequently allowed [0] to push on for longer, often enabling optimum race strategies, and [0]'s fuel usage has regularly been better than almost anyone on the grid. Sky Sport's Mark Hughes, commented: \"old karting teammate and friend Nico Rosberg has a more scientific methodology, looks to fine-tune more specifically than [0][0] [0]'s [0].\"In their's time together as teammates, [0] old karting teammate and friend Nico Rosberg won 54 of 78 races over four seasons. [0] had 32 victories, 55 podium finishes and qualified ahead of old karting teammate and friend Nico Rosberg 42 times. old karting teammate and friend Nico Rosberg had 22 victories, 50 podium finishes and qualified ahead of [0] 36 times. During this period, [0] won two World Championship titles to old karting teammate and friend Nico Rosberg's one, and scored more points in three out of their's four seasons together.[0] describes [0]'s rivalry with Sebastian Vettel as [0]'s favourite, believing their battles helped bring their closer together. After three years of Mercedes's dominance from 2014 to 2016, Ferrari produced a car that was capable of fighting for the World Drivers' Championship in 2017 and 2018. Sebastian Vettel, enjoyed an early lead on points, but Mercedes [0] fought back and ultimately won the championships in 2017 and 2018. While there were some on-track flash points, most notably the 2017 Azerbaijan Grand Prix, when Sebastian Vettel accused [0] of brake checking and drove into [0] in retaliation, earning a penalty, their developed a strong mutual respect in a hard but fairly contested fight. In 2021, [0] recalled:their battles were [0]'s favourite so far. It's knowing [0] was racing against Sebastian Vettel, not only Sebastian Vettel but a great man in Sebastian Vettel and their were racing against another team, Sebastian Vettel was at Ferrari. It took a lot out of their in that period of time, to remain focused to deliver weekend in, weekend out. that period of time was a difficult period for their and that period of time brought their closer, because a strong mutual respect is huge.

In 2007, [0] suffered racist abuse from Spanish Formula One supporters at the Chinese Grand Prix. In 2008, [0] was heckled and otherwise abused during pre-season testing at the Circuit de Catalunya by several Spanish spectators who wore black face paint and black wigs, as well as shirts bearing the words \"[0]'s familly [sic]\". The FIA warned Spanish authorities about the repetition of such behaviour, and launched a \"Race Against Racism\" campaign. Shortly before the 2008 Brazilian Grand Prix, a website owned by the Spanish branch of the New York-based advertising agency TBWA and named pinchalaruedadeHamilton, which translates into English as \"burst [0]'s tyre\", was featured in the British media.

The way minorities are treated has to change, how you educate those in your country of equality, racism, classism and that we are all the same. We are not born with racism and hate in our hearts, racism and hate is taught by those We look up to.
